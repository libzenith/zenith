[toolchain]
# We try to stick to a toolchain version that is widely available on popular distributions, so that most people
# can use the toolchain that comes with their operating system. But if there's a feature we miss badly from a later
# version, we can consider updating.
# See https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/rustc for more details on Debian rustc package,
# we use "unstable" version number as the highest version used in the project by default.
channel = "1.61" # do update GitHub CI cache values for rust builds, when changing this value
profile = "default"
# The default profile includes rustc, rust-std, cargo, rust-docs, rustfmt and clippy.
# https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/profiles.html
# but we also need `llvm-tools-preview` for coverage data merges on CI
