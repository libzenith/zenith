//!
//! RCU stands for Read-Copy-Update. It's a synchronization mechanism somewhat
//! similar to a lock, but it allows readers to "hold on" to an old value of RCU
//! without blocking writers, and allows writing a new values without blocking
//! readers. When you update the new value, the new value is immediately visible
//! to new readers, but the update waits until all existing readers have
//! finishe, so that no one sees the old value anymore.
//!
//! This implementation isn't wait-free; it uses an RwLock that is held for a
//! short duration when the value is read or updated.
//!
