//! This crate contains no code.
//!
//! The workspace_hack crate exists only to pin down some dependencies,
//! so that those dependencies always build with the same features,
//! under a few different cases that can be problematic:
//! - Running `cargo check` or `cargo build` from a crate sub-directory
//!   instead of the workspace root.
//! - Running `cargo install`, which can only be done per-crate
//!
//! The dependency lists in Cargo.toml were automatically generated by
//! a tool called
//! [Hakari](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy/tree/main/tools/hakari).
//!
//! Hakari doesn't have a CLI yet; in the meantime the example code in
//! their `README` file is enough to regenerate the dependencies.
//! Hakari's output was pasted into Cargo.toml, except for the
//! following manual edits:
//! - `winapi` dependency was removed. This is probably just due to the
//!   fact that Hakari's target analysis is incomplete.
//!
//! There isn't any penalty to this data falling out of date; it just
//! means that under the conditions above Cargo will rebuild more
//! packages than strictly necessary.
