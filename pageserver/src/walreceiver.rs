//! WAL receiver manages an open connection to safekeeper, to get the WAL it streams into.
//! To do so, a current implementation needs to do the following:
//!
//! * acknowledge the timelines that it needs to stream WAL into.
//! Pageserver is able to dynamically (un)load tenants on attach and detach,
//! hence WAL receiver needs to react on such events.
//!
//! * get a broker subscription, stream data from it to determine that a timeline needs WAL streaming.
//! For that, it watches specific keys in storage_broker and pulls the relevant data periodically.
//! The data is produced by safekeepers, that push it periodically and pull it to synchronize between each other.
//! Without this data, no WAL streaming is possible currently.
//!
//! Only one active WAL streaming connection is allowed at a time.
//! The connection is supposed to be updated periodically, based on safekeeper timeline data.
//!
//! * handle the actual connection and WAL streaming
//!
//! Handling happens dynamically, by portions of WAL being processed and registered in the server.
//! Along with the registration, certain metadata is written to show WAL streaming progress and rely on that when considering safekeepers for connection.
//!
//! The current module contains high-level primitives used in the submodules; general synchronization, timeline acknowledgement and shutdown logic.
