//!
//! Zenith stores PostgreSQL relations, and some other files, in the
//! repository.  The relations (i.e. tables and indexes) take up most
//! of the space in a typical installation, while the other files are
//! small. We call each relation and other file that is stored in the
//! repository a "relish". It comes from "rel"-ish, as in "kind of a
//! rel", because it covers relations as well as other things that are
//! not relations, but are treated similarly for the purposes of the
//! storage layer.
//!
//! This source file contains the definition of the RelishTag struct,
//! which uniquely identifies a relish.
//!
//! Relishes come in two flavors: blocky and non-blocky. Relations and
//! SLRUs are blocky, that is, they are divided into 8k blocks, and
//! the repository tracks their size. Other relishes are non-blocky:
//! the content of the whole relish is stored as one blob. Block
//! number must be passed as 0 for all operations on a non-blocky
//! relish. The one "block" that you store in a non-blocky relish can
//! have arbitrary size, but they are expected to be small, or you
//! will have performance issues.
//!
//! All relishes are versioned by LSN in the repository.
//!
