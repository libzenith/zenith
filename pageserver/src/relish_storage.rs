//! Abstractions for the page server to store its relish layer data in the external storage.
//!
//! Main purpose of this module subtree is to provide a set of abstractions to manage the storage state
//! in a way, optimal for page server.
//!
//! The abstractions hide multiple custom external storage API implementations,
//! such as AWS S3, local filesystem, etc., located in the submodules.
