/// Zenith timeline IDs are different from PostgreSQL timeline
/// IDs. They serve a similar purpose though: they differentiate
/// between different "histories" of the same cluster.  However,
/// PostgreSQL timeline IDs are a bit cumbersome, because they are only
/// 32-bits wide, and they must be in ascending order in any given
/// timeline history.  Those limitations mean that we cannot generate a
/// new PostgreSQL timeline ID by just generating a random number. And
/// that in turn is problematic for the "pull/push" workflow, where you
/// have a local copy of a zenith repository, and you periodically sync
/// the local changes with a remote server. When you work "detached"
/// from the remote server, you cannot create a PostgreSQL timeline ID
/// that's guaranteed to be different from all existing timelines in
/// the remote server. For example, if two people are having a clone of
/// the repository on their laptops, and they both create a new branch
/// with different name. What timeline ID would they assign to their
/// branches? If they pick the same one, and later try to push the
/// branches to the same remote server, they will get mixed up.
///
/// To avoid those issues, Zenith has its own concept of timelines that
/// is separate from PostgreSQL timelines, and doesn't have those
/// limitations. A zenith timeline is identified by a 128-bit ID, which
/// is usually printed out as a hex string.
