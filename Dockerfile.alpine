# Docker image for console integration testing.
#
# We may also reuse it in CI to unify installation process and as a general binaries building
# tool for production servers.
#
# Dynamic linking is used for librocksdb and libstdc++ bacause librocksdb-sys calls
# bindgen with "dynamic" feature flag. This also prevents usage of dockerhub alpine-rust
# images which are statically linked and have guards against any dlopen. I would rather
# prefer all static binaries so we may change the way librocksdb-sys builds or wait until
# we will have our own storage and drop rockdb dependency.
#
# Cargo-chef is used to separate dependencies building from main binaries building. This
# way `docker build` will download and install dependencies only of there are changes to
# out Cargo.toml files.

# build postgres separately -- this layer will be rebuilt only if one of
# mentioned paths will get any changes
